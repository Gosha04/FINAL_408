For getting python proj on your own machine w dependencies:
- Make sure you have `uv` installed
  - if not, run either `brew install uv` or `pip install uv `
  - `brew` better 
- clone github repo or pull new changes
- `cd app` to change to app directory
- run: `uv pip install -r pyproject.toml`
- then go to whatever IDE you're using to set interpeter
- find "Select Interpreter option"
- Add existing interpreter
- Go to folder where proj is, go to `.venv/bin/python3.13` and select it

    - Dealerships should be able to hold onto and operate all the objects they store
        - They should be able to add, remove, etc.
    - Employees ought to have functionality to be worked on by Dealership
